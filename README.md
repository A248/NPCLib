This is an API made specifically for spigot servers (Minecraft). Current supported versions: **1.8 - 1.12**. Lightweight replacement for Citizens. NPCLib only uses packets instead of registering the entity in the actual Minecraft server.

### Notice
If any developer out there knows how to convert this project to Maven, please consider contacting me or creating a pull request. I have yet to come up with a good solution for the (older) NMS code repositories. I would love to add a CI system to this repository for easier collaboration.

## Code Example

```Java
    // First we define our (global) library variable.
    // This is usually done in the onEnable method.
    NPCLib lib = new NPCLib(plugin);
```

```Java

   // Creating an NPC.
   NPC npc = lib.createNPC(skin, lines);

   // The generate the packets for the NPC.
   npc.create(location);

   // Then *finally* you can show/hide it to/from players.
   npc.show(player);
   npc.hide(player);

   // If you don't use the NPC anymore, destroy the NPC accordingly.
   npc.destroy();
```

Usable events: `NPCSpawnEvent`, `NPCDestroyEvent` and `NPCInteractEvent`.
